## What this project is

The system's development philosophy is aimed towards being simple in usage, yet scalable in capacity.

## Who this project is aimed towards

This is an open source project aimed towards home users and tinkerers that would like to test out an open source monitoring and data aggregation platform, that is not as complicated as the current solutions out there. A dead simple solution that is usable after a 3 minute install.
